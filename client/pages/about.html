				Headphones (or head-phones in the early days of telephony and radio) are a pair of small loudspeaker drivers worn on
				or around the head over a user's ears. They are electroacoustic transducers, which convert an electrical signal to a
				corresponding sound. Headphones let a single user listen to an audio source privately, in contrast to a loudspeaker,
				which emits sound into the open air for anyone nearby to hear. 
				Headphones are also known as earspeakers, earphones or, colloquially, cans. Circumaural and supra-aural headphones use a
				band over the top of the head to hold the speakers in place. The other type, known as earbuds or earpieces consist of
				individual units that plug into the user's ear canal. In the context of telecommunication, a headset is a combination of
				headphone and microphone. Headphones connect to a signal source such as an audio amplifier, radio, CD player, portable
				media player, mobile phone, video game console, or electronic musical instrument, either directly using a cord, or using
				wireless technology such as Bluetooth, DECT or FM radio. The first headphones were developed in the late 19th century for
				use by telephone operators, to keep their hands free. Initially the audio quality was mediocre and a step forward was the
				invention of high fidelity headphones.
